# 🎭 Complete Game Rules

## Overview

**The Infiltrators & The Ghost** is a social deduction game where players use wordplay, observation, and tactical voting to achieve their team's victory. The game is played by passing a single device around, making it perfect for parties and gatherings.

## Setup

### Players
- **Minimum**: 3 players
- **Maximum**: 10 players
- **Recommended**: 5-7 players for optimal gameplay

### Roles Distribution
The game automatically assigns:
- **1 Undercover Agent**
- **1 Mr. White**
- **Remaining players**: Civilians

Example with 6 players:
- 4 Civilians
- 1 Undercover
- 1 Mr. White

## The Roles

### 🛡️ Civilian (Blue Team)
**Word**: Receives a Hindi word (e.g., "किताब")

**Goal**: Identify and eliminate both infiltrators (Undercover and Mr. White)

**Strategy**:
- Give specific clues that only other Civilians would understand
- Build consensus with other players
- Look for players giving vague or inconsistent clues
- Don't be too obvious - the Undercover might catch on!

### 🎯 Undercover (Red Team)
**Word**: Receives an English word related to the Civilian word (e.g., "Novel" when Civilians have "किताब")

**Goal**: Survive until only 2 players remain (you + Mr. White) OR eliminate all Civilians

**Strategy**:
- Your word is related but different
- Give clues that could apply to both words
- Blend in with the Civilians
- Try to identify Mr. White without being obvious
- Don't give clues that are too specific to your word

### 👻 Mr. White (Red Team)
**Word**: No word at all! ❓

**Goal**: Survive until only 2 players remain (you + Undercover) OR eliminate all Civilians

**Strategy**:
- Listen carefully to everyone's clues
- Give very general clues that could apply to anything
- Adapt based on what others say
- Try to identify the Undercover
- Be creative and confident!

**Important**: Undercover and Mr. White don't know each other's identities but share the same victory condition!

## Game Flow

### Phase 1: Role Assignment (Secret)
1. The app randomly assigns roles
2. Players pass the device around
3. Each player privately views their role and word
4. **Critical**: Keep your role and word secret!

### Phase 2: Description Round
1. Players sit in a circle or agreed order
2. Each player gives **ONE clue** about their word
3. Clues should be:
   - Single words or short phrases
   - Verbal (spoken aloud)
   - Related to your word (or improvised if you're Mr. White!)

**Example Clues**:
- Civilian (किताब): "Pages", "Reading", "Library"
- Undercover (Novel): "Story", "Author", "Fiction"
- Mr. White: "Information", "Paper" (guessing based on others)

### Phase 3: Discussion
1. After all players give clues, open discussion begins
2. Players debate who seems suspicious
3. Look for:
   - Inconsistent clues
   - Overly vague descriptions
   - Players who seem confused
   - Clues that don't match the pattern

**Tips**:
- Ask questions
- Challenge suspicious players
- Build alliances (but be careful!)
- Infiltrators might try to frame Civilians

### Phase 4: Voting
1. Group votes to eliminate one player
2. Tap on a player's avatar to vote
3. Player with most votes is eliminated
4. Eliminated player's role is **revealed immediately**

**Voting Strategy**:
- Civilians: Try to eliminate infiltrators
- Infiltrators: Try to eliminate Civilians OR frame each other (risky!)
- Consider voting patterns and alliances

### Phase 5: Role Reveal
- The eliminated player's role and word are shown to everyone
- This is a critical information moment!
- Adjust your strategy based on who was eliminated

### Phase 6: Continue or Victory
The game checks for victory conditions:

**If no one wins**: Return to Phase 2 (new round)

**If victory condition met**: Game ends!

## Victory Conditions

### 🛡️ Civilians Win When:
Both infiltrators have been eliminated
- ✅ Undercover is eliminated AND
- ✅ Mr. White is eliminated

### 🎯 Infiltrators Win When:
ONE of these conditions is met:

1. **Only 2 players remain** and both are:
   - Undercover + Mr. White

2. **Only infiltrators remain** (all Civilians eliminated)

3. **Only 1 Civilian remains** with any infiltrators

## Word System

### Difficulty Levels

#### Easy
- Common everyday objects
- Clear relationships
- Example: चाय (Chai) vs Coffee

#### Medium  
- Moderately familiar concepts
- Requires thought
- Example: डॉक्टर (Doctor) vs Nurse

#### Hard
- Abstract concepts
- Subtle differences
- Similar meanings
- Example: न्याय (Nyay) vs Justice

### Hindi-English Pairing
- **Civilians**: Always get Hindi word (Devanagari script)
- **Undercover**: Always get English word
- **Mr. White**: Gets no word (blank)

This creates an interesting dynamic where language itself can be a clue!

## Advanced Strategy

### For Civilians
1. **Don't be too obvious early** - Undercover might figure out the word
2. **Build trust networks** - Find other Civilians
3. **Look for outliers** - Who's giving different types of clues?
4. **Count votes** - Who's voting suspiciously?
5. **Remember past clues** - Patterns emerge over rounds

### For Undercover
1. **Listen first** - Let Civilians give clues before you
2. **Stay in the middle** - Not too specific, not too vague
3. **Find Mr. White subtly** - You need each other!
4. **Redirect suspicion** - Point to the most vocal Civilian
5. **Know when to sacrifice** - Sometimes throwing Mr. White under the bus helps you survive

### For Mr. White
1. **Ultra-generic clues** - "Common", "Useful", "Important"
2. **Echo patterns** - Use similar adjectives to others
3. **Confident delivery** - Act like you know exactly what you're talking about
4. **Identify word category quickly** - Object? Concept? Activity?
5. **Partner with Undercover** - Once identified, work together

## Special Scenarios

### Tie Votes
If voting results in a tie:
- Discuss and vote again
- OR skip elimination for that round

### Player Dropout
If a player must leave:
- That player is eliminated
